      "note": "<!-- Nightly Only -->Starting with Firefox 113, Nightly and early beta builds now behave similar to the other browsers when splitting a node (e.g., typing `Enter` to split a paragraph) and joining two nodes (e.g., typing `Backspace` at start of a paragraph to join the paragraph and the previous one) when using the built-in editor. When a node is split, the built-in editor creates new node after the original one, i.e., creates the right node. Similarly, when two nodes are joined, the built-in editor deletes the latter node and moves its children to end of the preceding node.\r\n\r\nThis new behavior can also be enabled by web apps themselves for all channels with a call of `document.execCommand(\"enableCompatibleJoinSplitDirection\", false, \"false\")` (introduced in [bug 1810663][1]). This command is available only when `designMode` is set to `\"on\"` or there is at least one editable element which has `contenteditable` attribute, and the built-in editor has not handled the `insertParagraph`, `delete`, or `forwardDelete` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1810663",
