      "note": "Say hello to a fresh new Firefox, designed to get you where you want to go even faster. We\u2019ve redesigned and modernized the core experience to be cleaner, more inviting, and easier to use. \r\n\r\nBeginning in 89, you\u2019ll notice a number of changes, including:\r\n\r\n* **Simplified browser chrome and toolbar**: Less frequently used items removed to focus on the most important navigation items.\r\n- **Clear, streamlined menus**: Re-organized and prioritized menu content according to usage. Updated labels and removed iconography.\r\n- **Updated prompts**: Infobars, panels, and modals have a cleaner design and clearer language.\r\n- **Inspired tab design**: Floating tabs neatly contain information and surface cues when you need them, like visual indicators for audio controls. The rounded design of the active tab supports focus and signals the ability to easily move the tab as needed.\r\n- **Fewer interruptions**: Reduced number of alerts and messages, so you can browse with fewer distractions.\r\n- **Cohesive, calmer visuals**: Lighter iconography, a refined color palette, and more consistent styling throughout. \r\n- **Native context menus**: Context menus on macOS are now native and support Dark Mode.\r\n\r\n![native context menus screeshot][1]\r\n\r\nThis release also includes enhancements to our privacy offerings: \r\n\r\n* [We\u2019ve enhanced the privacy of the Firefox Browser\u2019s Private Browsing mode][2] with Total Cookie Protection, which confines cookies to the site where they were created, preventing [companies from using cookies to track your browsing][3] across sites. This feature was originally launched in Firefox\u2019s ETP Strict mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/firefox/releasenotes/note-images/native_macos_context_menus.png\r\n  [2]: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/06/01/total-cookie-protection-in-private-browsing\r\n  [3]: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/",
