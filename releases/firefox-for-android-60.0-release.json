This release includes changes that give you more content and more ways to customize your New Tab/Firefox Home. It also introduces support for the Web Authentication API, which means you can log in to websites in Firefox with USB tokens like YubiKey. \r\nFirefox 60 also brings a new policy engine and Group Policy support for enterprise deployments. For more info about why and how to use Firefox in the enterprise, see [this blog post][1]. \r\n\r\nThank you to all of the [new Mozillians][2] who contributed to this release of Firefox!\r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/enterprise/\r\n[1]: https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/open-for-business-firefox-quantum-is-ready-for-it-622c74fe13fe\r\n[2]: https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2018/05/02/firefox-60-new-contributors/",
