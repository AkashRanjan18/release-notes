      "note": "HTTPS DNS records can now be resolved with the operating system's DNS resolver on specific platforms (Windows 11, Linux, Android 10+). Previously this required DNS over HTTPS to be enabled. This capability allows the use of HTTP/3 without needing to use the `Alt-Svc` header, upgrades requests to HTTPS when the DNS record is present, and enables wider use of ECH.",
