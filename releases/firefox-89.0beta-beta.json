      "note": "Say hello to a fresh new Firefox, designed to get you where you want to go even faster. We\u2019ve redesigned and modernized the core experience to be cleaner, more inviting, and easier to use. \r\n\r\nBeginning in 89, you\u2019ll notice a number of changes, including:\r\n\r\n* **Simplified browser chrome and toolbar**: Redundant or less frequently used features have been removed to focus on the most important navigation items.\r\n* **Streamlined menus**: Content has been re-organized and prioritized according to usage. We\u2019ve reduced visual noise by removing unnecessary iconography and provided clearer labels. \r\n* **Updated prompts**: Infobars and modals have a cleaner design and clearer language. \r\n* **Inspired new tab design**: Floating tabs neatly contain information and surface cues when you need them, like visual indicators for audio controls. The rounded design of the active tab supports focus and signals the ability to easily move the tab as needed.\r\n* **Fewer interruptions**: We\u2019ve removed unnecessary alerts and messages. \r\n* **Cohesive, calmer visuals**: Lighter iconography, a refined color palette, and more consistent styling throughout. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis release also includes enhancements to our privacy offerings: \r\n\r\n* We\u2019ve enhanced the privacy of the Firefox Browser\u2019s Private Browsing mode with Total Cookie Protection, which confines cookies to the site where they were created, preventing [companies from using cookies to track your browsing][1] from site to site. This feature was previously available only in Firefox\u2019s ETP Strict mode. \r\n* We are rolling out Version 2 of our [existing SmartBlock feature][2], which enables a seamless web page experience that would otherwise stop working when we block trackers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/\r\n  [2]: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/03/23/introducing-smartblock/",
