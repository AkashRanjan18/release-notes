  "text": "With this release, we\u2019re building on the great foundation provided by our all-new Firefox Quantum browser. We're optimizing the performance gains we released in 57 by improving the way we render graphics and cache JavaScript. We also made functional and privacy improvements to Firefox Screenshots. On Firefox for Android, we\u2019ve added support for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) so you can add websites to your home screen and use them like native apps.\r\n\r\nThank you to all of the new Mozillians who contributed to this release of Firefox!",
