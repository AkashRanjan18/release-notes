Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection will now automatically block third-party tracking cookies that appear on the [Disconnect list](https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection). Firefox will continue to block third-party tracking loads in private windows, as it has done since version 42.\r\n\r\n- For existing users, while ETP will be rolling out by default in the coming months, [you can turn this feature on](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/content-blocking) today under Preferences, select Privacy & Security to select the Custom menu, and under the Content Blocking section, mark the Cookies checkbox and choose \u201cThird-party trackers\u201d in the Cookies pull down menu.",

Coupled with our browser, and with a Firefox account, they extend your online privacy and security and increase convenience, giving you peace of mind.\r\n\r\n- [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) version 2.0 expands functionality to prevent Facebook from tracking you on other websites that embed Facebook Likes, Shares and comments in their pages, greatly limiting Facebook\u2019s ability to track your activities across the web.\r\n- [Firefox Lockwise](https://lockwise.firefox.com/) (formerly Lockbox), with its new name, look and feel, is now fully cross-platform with the introduction of the Lockwise desktop extension in this release. With the [Android](https://app.adjust.com/gi0ycmr?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dmozilla.lockbox) and [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/qywno6t?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1314000270%3Fmt%3D8) apps, and now with the [desktop extension](https://lockwise.firefox.com/), Lockwise allows you to [take your passwords](https://support.mozilla.org/products/firefox-lockwise) across all devices and safely auto-fill login details as you need on any browser or app once logged in with a Firefox account.\r\n- [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/) 2.0 expands its capabilities to allow users with a Firefox account to monitor multiple email addresses and receive email alerts when any of them are involved in a known breach. A dashboard also helps to show the total number of known breaches in which your email addresses have been involved.\r\n- [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/) allows you to send files up to 1GB with end-to-end encryption and a link that automatically expires; with a Firefox account, the size limit becomes 2.5GB with additional controls for number of downloads or days, and the ability to password protect the file.",
