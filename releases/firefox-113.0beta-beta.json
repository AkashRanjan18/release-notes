When a node is split, the built-in editor creates a new node after the original one, i.e., creates the right node. Similarly, when two nodes are joined, the built-in editor deletes the latter node and moves its children to the end of the preceding node.\r\n\r\nThis behavior change can be enabled for testing by web apps now with a call of `document.execCommand(\"enableCompatibleJoinSplitDirection\", false, \"false\")`. This command is available only when `designMode` is set to `\"on\"` or there is at least one editable element which has the `contenteditable` attribute, and the built-in editor has not handled the `insertParagraph`, `delete`, or `forwardDelete` command.",
