Now you can find a color to suit (or lift) your every mood.\r\n**Fun fact:** Did you know we have more daily users with color themes than dark or Alpenglow on Beta? With Firefox 89, 32% of users clicked through to customize their color theme. And that was just on the first day! We decided to introduce these new Colorways to give our users more to love.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/firefox/releasenotes/note-images/ColorThemeMotion_v3_800.gif",
