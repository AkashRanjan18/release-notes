      "note": "### General\r\n\r\n* Windows 7-8.1 and macOS 10.12-10.14 are no longer supported operating systems.\r\n* Firefox now supports automated translation of web content. Also, unlike cloud-based alternatives, translation is done locally so that the text being translated never leaves the machine.\r\n* The line breaking rules of web content now match the Unicode standard, improving cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, for East Asian and South East Asian end users, Firefox now supports proper language-aware word selection when double-clicking on text for languages including Chinese, Japanese, Burmese, Lao, Khmer, and Thai.\r\n* Video effects and background blur are now available to Firefox users on Google Meet.\r\nFirefox now displays images and descriptions for search suggestions when provided by the search engine.\r\n* It is now possible to copy and paste any file from the operating system into Firefox.\r\n* Having any issues with a website on Firefox, yet the site seems to be working as expected on another browser? You can now let us know via the Web Compatibility Reporting Tool! By filing a web compatibility issue, you\u2019re directly helping us detect, target, and fix the most impacted sites to make your browsing experience on Firefox smoother.\r\n* Firefox now prompts users in the US and Canada to save their addresses upon submitting an address form, allowing Firefox to autofill stored address information in the future.\r\n* Support for credit card autofill has been extended to users running Firefox in the IT, ES, AT, BE, and PL locales.\r\n* Recently closed tabs now persist between sessions that don't have automatic session restore enabled. Manually restoring a previous session will continue to reopen any previously open tabs or windows.\r\n* When migrating data from Chrome, Firefox now offers the ability to import certain extensions as well.\r\n* The Screenshots feature in Firefox has been updated. It now supports taking screenshots of file types like SVG, XML, and more as well as various about: pages within Firefox. The screenshot tool was also made more accessible to everyone by implementing new keyboard shortcuts and adding theme compatibility and High Contrast Mode (HCM) support. And finally, performance for capturing large screenshots has been improved.",

As before, recently closed tabs are also listed on Firefox View.\r\nTo access Firefox View, select the file folder icon at the top left of your tab strip.\r\n* We\u2019ve integrated search into Firefox View. You can now search through all of the tabs on each of the section subpages - Recent Browsing, Open Tabs, Recently Closed Tabs, Tabs from other devices, or History.\r\n* In Firefox View, open tabs can now be sorted by either recent activity or tab order. Recent activity is the default setting.\r\n* Firefox View now displays pinned tabs in the Open tabs section. Tab indicators have also been added to Open tabs, so users can do things like see which tabs are playing media and quickly mute or unmute across windows. Indicators were also added for bookmarks, tabs with notifications, and more!\r\n* It is now possible to close all duplicate tabs in a window with the `Close duplicate tabs` command available from the `List all tabs` widget in the tab bar or a tab context menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-set-tab-pickup-firefox-view",

This will be enabled by default on Windows, macOS, and Android, and if needed, can be turned off in settings (Settings \u2192 Privacy & Security \u2192 Certificates).\r\n* The [Storage Access API][3] web standard was updated to improve security while mitigating website breakages and further enabling the phase out of third-party cookies in Firefox.\r\n* Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is now available to Firefox users, delivering a more private browsing experience. ECH extends the encryption used in TLS connections to cover more of the handshake and better protect sensitive fields. Read more about the launch of ECH on [Mozilla Distilled][4].\r\n* Firefox supports a new \u201cCopy Link Without Site Tracking\u201d feature in the context menu which ensures that copied links no longer contain tracking information.\r\n* Firefox now supports a setting (in Preferences \u2192 Privacy & Security) to enable [Global Privacy Control][5]. With this opt-in feature, Firefox informs the websites that the user doesn\u2019t want their data to be shared or sold. This feature is enabled in private browsing mode by default.\r\n* Firefox now more proactively blocks downloads from URLs that are considered to be potentially untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://support.mozilla.org/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins\r\n  [2]: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-a-passkey-mchl4af65d1a/mac\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API\r\n  [4]: https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/encrypted-hello/\r\n  [5]: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/",
