If you want to keep using Emacs like key bindings, e.g., you configured your GTK settings to use `Ctrl-a` as a shortcut key for moving caret to beginning of a line, you need to change `ui.key.textcontrol.prefer_native_key_bindings_over_builtin_shortcut_key_definitions` and `ui.key.use_select_all_in_single_line_editor` from `about:config`. These prefs are currently disabled by default but would be enabled by default in a future release.",
